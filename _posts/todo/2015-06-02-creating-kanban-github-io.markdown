I had this idea to convert this page in to a lightweight kanban board.

The goal of this board is a place to brainstorm, prioritize, and document some of the things
I am doing and things I want to do in the future.

I think that the top section is a great place to act as a showcase for whatever im currently up to. Yes, its a little meta right now.


Some things I still have to do

* test on mobile
* links to git repos?
