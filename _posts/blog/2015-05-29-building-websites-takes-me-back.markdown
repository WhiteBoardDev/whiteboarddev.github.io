Well its that time again. Every once in a while (once a year at this rate) I get
a wild hair and have to spend the day building a web site. This time im interested
in how github pages work. The concept so far is pretty simple.

1. build a website
2. publish website to github with a special repo-name
3. done

Here is the problem: github pages are only static. No php, no java, no databases.
On comes jekyll, a static website engine that allows a static website to be built
from many different source files in a fairly straightforward way.

So far I like

*	ability to make custom html pages like any normal website
*	ability to add any js/css framework like any normal website
* 	has simple structure for managing variables and rendering those variables into
templates
* 	ruby anyone?

Im trying to make it "responsive", the most overused term in web design, by cheating
and loading up bootstrap. I'm having a little issue with the front page but im sure
it will work out eventually.
